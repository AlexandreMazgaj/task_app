This application helps you manage your tasks easily. You can create lists of tasks, and new tasks in each list of tasks you create.
You can create lists of tasks by clicking on the input, naming your list and pressing enter. Then you will see a the list of tasks of the list you have just created, you can add new tasks by clicking on the input where "I have to..." is written, you can then simply press enter. Each tasks has a checkbox, to help you remember if you have finished the task or not, once you check a checkbox, the tasks will be stricken, but it is up to you to delete it or not. You can edit and delete each task and each list of tasks. To delete, you can simply click on the little trash icon. To edit a task you can click on the task, and enter the new name of your task and then press enter. To edit a list of task, you can click on the little button with a pencil icon, write the new name of your list and then press enter.
